# ScrubbyWeb

This is the public release of ScrubbyWeb, the web front-end for my Scrubby project.

This public release does not constitute the entire application, and cannot by itself serve the entire Scrubby platform. This is only the web front-end available at https://scrubby.melonmesa.com/. This does *not* include the parsing server (ScrubbyServer) and common schema project (ScrubbyCommon).

This release aims to improve transparency in understanding how Scrubby works, and how it uses the information of users.

If you have any further questions, please contact me on Discord (bobbahbrown#0001).
